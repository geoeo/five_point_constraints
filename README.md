# Five Point Constraints

Computing the symbolic contraints matrix needed for the 5-Point Algorithm using Gr√∂ber Basis.
The ordering is given to match the construnction in Photomgrammetric Computer Vision p.575 and Recent Developments on Direct Relative
Orientation by Stewenius et al. The orderings in the references however seem wrong, and should be Grevlex.

The code is written to work with Rust and nalgebra.
